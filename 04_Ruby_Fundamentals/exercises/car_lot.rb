#Create 3 or more hashes with cars - include 5 keys 
  #- brand, model, year, price, electric
#Create an array of hashes
#Iterate through the array using the `.each` method
#Practice using `if` && `unless` conditionals (print a special message when cars are good for the enviornment)
#*** BONUS **** create a `add_cars` method that takes an unlimited number of cars and transforms them into an array

require 'pry'

def show_all_cars(cars)
end

#write a method that accepts an unlimited number of cars (or arguments)
def add_cars()
